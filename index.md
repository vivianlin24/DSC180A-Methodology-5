**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I think the most interesting topic has been building models that are able to predict how people feel 
about certain political issues based on what the people have tweeted about presidential candidates. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to further pursue this topic I mentioned above and build a model that can more accurately 
make these predictions. I would like to do further research and investigation to find out how to make
this model better at predicting people's opinions about political issues like abortion, affirmative action, 
gun control, and more. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I think we are so focused on figuring out specific things to tweak in the model, but because we will have 
more time to complete the project in Quarter 2, I would honestly like to start over and go from there. 
I think we are so zoned in on fixing what we already have that we may be limited ourselves to other
possibilities that can make the objective successful. I am not sure what that will be, so I would 
like to explore those options more. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am super interested in trying models that we have learned before in other DSC classes, such as the 
Bag-of-Words Model and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. I would also like to explore other 
model types like Support Vector Machines and Word2Vec models. I think these can all be interesting if 
we are looking at tweets of people.
